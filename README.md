# 📘 Introduction to PostgreSQL Course

Welcome to the "Introduction to PostgreSQL" course! This course is designed for beginners who want to understand how relational databases work and how to use PostgreSQL for real-world applications. Below is a structured overview of all the topics covered.

---

## 🧠 Basic Concepts

### 🔹 What is a Database?
A database is an organized collection of data that can be easily accessed, managed, and updated.

### 🔹 Database vs DBMS
A DBMS (Database Management System) is software used to store, retrieve, and manage data in databases. It acts as an interface between users and the database.

### 🔹 What is RDBMS?
RDBMS stands for Relational Database Management System. It organizes data into related tables using rows and columns.

## 🧱 PostgreSQL Structure

### 🔹 Database vs Schema vs Table
- A **Database** is the highest-level container that holds related data.
- A **Schema** is a logical grouping of tables within a database.
- A **Table** is where actual data is stored in a structured format (rows and columns).

## 📁 Section 1: Database and CRUD Operations

### 🔹 Database Create, Drop, List & Switch
Learn how to create a new database, delete it, view all databases, and switch between them using PostgreSQL commands.

### 🔹 What is CRUD?
CRUD stands for Create, Read, Update, and Delete — the four basic operations you can perform on data in a database.

### 🔹 CREATE Table
Creating tables involves defining columns, data types, and constraints for storing structured data.

### 🔹 INSERT Data
Inserting data means adding new records into a table.

### 🔹 SELECT (Reading Data)
The SELECT operation is used to retrieve data from one or more tables.

### 🔹 UPDATE
Updating allows you to modify existing records in a table.

### 🔹 DELETE
The DELETE command removes one or more records from a table.

## 📊 Section 2: Data Types and Constraints

### 🔹 Datatypes
Data types define the kind of data a column can hold, such as integers, text, dates, booleans, etc.

### 🔹 Constraints
Constraints ensure data integrity by applying rules to table columns. Common constraints include:
- **Primary Key**: Uniquely identifies each row.
- **NOT NULL**: Prevents null (empty) values.
- **DEFAULT**: Sets a default value if none is provided.
- **CHECK**: Validates column values.
- **Foreign Key**: Links records between tables.

## 🧪 Practical Tasks and Filtering

### 🔹 Task: Create an Employee Table
A practical exercise to define a table with proper columns, data types, and constraints.

### 🔹 WHERE, ORDER BY, DISTINCT, LIMIT, LIKE
These clauses help refine query results by filtering, sorting, removing duplicates, limiting rows, or using patterns.

---

## 🔣 Operators and Functions

### 🔹 Relational and Logical Operators
Operators like =, >, <, AND, OR, NOT are used to form conditions in queries.

### 🔹 Aggregate Functions
Functions such as COUNT, MIN, MAX, AVG, and SUM are used to perform calculations on data sets.

### 🔹 GROUP BY
Used to group rows that have the same values in specified columns, often used with aggregate functions.

### 🔹 String Functions
Functions like CONCAT, REPLACE, and SUBSTR help manipulate text data.

---

## 🔄 Advanced SQL Concepts

### 🔹 ALTER Query
Used to modify the structure of an existing table (e.g., adding or changing columns).

### 🔹 CHECK Constraint
Ensures that values in a column meet a specific condition.

### 🔹 CASE Expression
Allows conditional logic in SQL queries (similar to if-else statements).

---

## 🔗 Relationships and Keys

### 🔹 Relationship and its Types
Defines how tables are connected: one-to-one, one-to-many, and many-to-many.

### 🔹 Foreign Key
Establishes a link between the data in two tables to maintain referential integrity.

### 🔹 One-to-One Relationship
Each record in one table is linked to only one record in another table.

### 🔹 Many-to-Many Relationship
Records in one table are associated with multiple records in another and vice versa, usually managed with a junction table.

---

## 🔁 JOINs and Advanced Features

### 🔹 JOINs and Its Types
Combines rows from two or more tables based on related columns. Types include INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN, RIGHT JOIN, and FULL OUTER JOIN.

### 🔹 VIEWS
A view is a virtual table based on the result of an SQL query. It simplifies complex queries and enhances security.

### 🔹 HAVING Clause
Used to filter groups created by GROUP BY based on aggregate functions.

### 🔹 Stored Procedures
Reusable blocks of SQL code stored in the database that perform actions like insert, update, etc.

### 🔹 User Defined Functions
Custom functions created by the user to perform specific operations and return results.

---

## 📈 Advanced SQL Tools

### 🔹 WINDOW Functions
Perform calculations across a set of table rows that are somehow related to the current row, without collapsing the result set.

### 🔹 CTE (Common Table Expression)
A temporary result set defined within the execution scope of a single SQL query, often used to simplify complex joins or subqueries.

### 🔹 TRIGGERS
Automatic actions executed in response to specific events (like INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE) on a table.
